when the comunication takes over true http/rest allways must know 


    It only directly supports the request/response style of interaction. You can use HTTP for notifications but the server must always send an HTTP response.
    Because the client and service communicate directly (without an intermediary to buffer messages), they must both be running for the duration of the exchange.
    The client must know the location (i.e., the URL) of each service instance. As described in the previous article about the API Gateway, this is a nonâ€‘trivial problem in a modern application. Clients must use a service discovery mechanism to locate service instances.
